# Federated Learning DeSci: Revolutionizing Medical AI with Secure Collaboration

Federated Learning DeSci is an innovative platform that enables hospitals to collaboratively train a medical AI diagnostic model without sharing sensitive patient data. This powerful capability is underpinned by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, ensuring that patient privacy and data sovereignty are maintained throughout the entire training process.

## The Challenge of Data Privacy in Healthcare

In the rapidly evolving field of healthcare, the need for advanced AI-driven diagnostic models is crucial. However, hospitals often face significant hurdles: the sharing of sensitive patient data raises privacy concerns and compliance issues with regulations such as HIPAA. Traditional data-sharing methods can result in serious risks to patient confidentiality, creating a barrier to collaboration among institutions striving to improve healthcare outcomes.

## How Zama's FHE Transforms Collaboration

By leveraging Zama’s cutting-edge **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, Federated Learning DeSci allows hospitals to securely update a shared AI model without exposing their underlying patient data. The model's training data remains encrypted at all times, and updates to the model (in the form of encrypted gradients) are conducted seamlessly through Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**. This ensures confidential collaboration, fostering innovation in medical AI while upholding the highest standards of patient privacy.

## Core Functionalities

- **Encrypted Model Updates**: Hospitals can share model updates without ever exposing patient information, thanks to FHE encryption of the gradients.
- **DAO Coordination**: A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governs the collaboration process, incentivizing participation from hospitals while ensuring fair and equitable decision-making.
- **Enhanced AI Training**: The collaborative platform enables more robust AI models that leverage diverse data sources, ultimately improving diagnostic accuracy.
- **Data Sovereignty and Privacy Protection**: The system is designed to respect and protect patients' rights and data, addressing legal and ethical considerations.
- **Monitoring and Governance**: Real-time monitoring of model training and governance through DAO makes the process transparent and accountable.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama SDK**: Utilizing **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs** to implement the core fully homomorphic encryption functionalities.
- **Node.js**: An open-source JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment for Ethereum software to facilitate testing and deployment.
- **Solidity**: Programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the Federated Learning DeSci project, please follow these steps carefully:

1. **Pre-requisites**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. **Download the Project**: Obtain the project files via your preferred method (ensure you do not use git clone).
3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal and change the directory to where you have stored the project files.
4. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies, including the Zama FHE libraries:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5. **Install Hardhat**: If you haven't done so, install Hardhat globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g hardhat
    ```

## Building and Running the Project

Once you have completed the installation, you can compile and test the project.

### To Compile the Smart Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### To Run Tests
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### To Deploy the Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network yourNetworkName
```

## Example Usage

Here’s a snippet demonstrating how to use the Federated Learning DeSci platform to update the model:

```javascript
const { encryptGradient, updateModel } = require('./fheUtils');

async function federatedUpdate(newData) {
    const encryptedGradient = encryptGradient(newData);
    await updateModel(encryptedGradient);
}

// Assuming newData is the model update computed by a participating hospital
federatedUpdate(newData);
```
